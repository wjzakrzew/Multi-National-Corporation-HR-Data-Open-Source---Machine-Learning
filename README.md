# HR Open Data- Machine Learning Project
Dataset was obtained via Kraggle and provides 2 million employee records from a Multi-National Corporation (MNC). 
The data includes personal identifiers, job-related attributes, performance, employment status, and salary information.

## Summary
The purpose of this data is to provide analytics for a large-scale company. This data was selected for a variety of reasons. Primarily, the data requires analysis in python because it has 2 million rows. 
As a previous manager, I am interested in identifying how performance evaluations and modes of working correspond to salaries and employee attrition. Finally, the data is global, allowing for location-based analytics.

## Data
All HR data was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/hr-data-mnc/data 
Code related to the python analysis can be found in this repository.
